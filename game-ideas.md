# Chaotic Cats Game Ideas

## Gameplay

- Idle game
- Cats generate chaos
- Chaos levels
  - No chaos, cats are bored, and automatically create chaos
    - user can help them create chaos (knocking items off the counter/table, etc)
    - user can play with cats
  - Low means monsters spawn slowly
    - user can send cats off to fight monsters
    - user can continue to play with cats, speeding up reaching the next chaos level
    - fighting generates more chaos
  - Medium means monsters spawn faster
    - user MUST send groups of cats off to fight before reaching high, or there will be too many monsters to fight
  - High monsters spawn faster
  - Critical (extreme?) and cats become tired and block buttons/actions
- Chaos is reset by cats taking a nap
- Nap time converts chaos into chaotic essence and resets back to no chaos
- Chaos (Chaotic Essence?) (Chaotic Energy?) is used to create cats
- The additional cats act as the prestige multiplier
